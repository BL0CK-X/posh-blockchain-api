# posh-blockchain-api

**This is a WIP**

Wrapper for the wonderful BlockchainAPI by Josh Wolff. AT PRESENT, IS UNFINISHED. CAN DO BASIC TASKS. See --> https://docs.blockchainapi.com/ for usage of the base API. All credit to https://github.com/joshwolff1

## USAGE

1. Clone and Import the module. `Import-Module .\path\to\psm1`
2. Run `Enter-BlockchainAPI` to be prompted to enter API key

Good to go! Run the rest of the cmdlets knowing your API keys are only local in your shell (and the parent API), never outside.
