# posh-blockchain-api
Wrapper for the wonderful BlockchainAPI by Josh Wolff

## USAGE

1. Import the module (won't work yet)
2. Run Enter-BlockchainAPI to be prompted to enter API key

Good to go! Run the rest of the cmdlets knowing your API keys are only local in your shell (and the parent API), never outside.
